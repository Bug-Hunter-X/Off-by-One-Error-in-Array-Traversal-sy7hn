# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.

The error arises from an incorrect loop condition in the `for` loop which leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution shows how to adjust the loop condition to avoid this error.
